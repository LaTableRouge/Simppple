# React Blocks

- Blocks are created by referring to this [tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/), or by referring to an existing block in this directory.

## File Structure

    - ðŸ“‚ scss
      - editor.scss
      - style.scss
    - ðŸ“‚ js

## Compilation

## Translation

- The translations for the blocks should be generated at the same time as those for the theme (See [README](../../../README.md#translation))
